# Hostinger Deployment Guide

## Your Site is Ready!

The website has been fully prepared for Hostinger deployment. All database dependencies have been removed, and forms continue working through Formspree.

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. **Removed Database Code**: All Supabase environment variables and unused database handlers have been removed
2. **Formspree Integration**: Both contact forms continue working via Formspree (endpoint already configured)
3. **Relative Paths**: Vite configured with `base: './'` for proper asset loading
4. **React Router Support**: `.htaccess` file included in `dist/` for client-side routing
5. **Production Build**: Site successfully built and optimized for deployment

## 📦 Deployment Steps

### 1. Upload the `dist` folder contents to Hostinger

1. Log into your Hostinger control panel
2. Go to **File Manager**
3. Navigate to `public_html/` directory
4. Upload ALL files from the `dist/` folder (not the folder itself)
5. Make sure `.htaccess` is uploaded (it's in the `dist/` folder)

### 2. Verify Upload Structure

Your `public_html/` should contain:
```
public_html/
├── .htaccess          (for routing)
├── index.html         (main HTML file)
├── assets/            (JS and CSS files)
├── fonts/             (custom fonts)
├── *.mp4, *.webm      (video files)
├── *.png              (images)
└── other files...
```

### 3. Test Your Live Site

- Visit your domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
- Test navigation between pages
- Submit a contact form to verify Formspree works
- Check all videos and images load correctly

## 🔧 Important Files

- **`.htaccess`**: Handles React Router redirects (already in `dist/`)
- **`index.html`**: Entry point with all meta tags and preloads
- **`assets/`**: Contains all bundled JavaScript and CSS

## 📝 Forms Configuration

Both forms use Formspree:
- **Contact Form**: `https://formspree.io/f/myznjawq`
- **Video Inquiry Form**: `https://formspree.io/f/myznjawq`

Forms will continue working as they currently do. No additional configuration needed.

## 🚀 Local Testing (Optional)

Before deploying, you can test locally:
```bash
npm run build     # Build for production
npm run preview   # Preview the build locally
```

## 📊 Build Output

The production build is optimized:
- Total size: ~695 KB (JavaScript + CSS)
- Gzipped: ~213 KB
- Code-split into vendor chunks for optimal loading
- All assets use relative paths

## ✅ Checklist Before Going Live

- [ ] All files from `dist/` uploaded to `public_html/`
- [ ] `.htaccess` file is present in `public_html/`
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Navigation between pages works
- [ ] Contact forms submit successfully
- [ ] Videos and images display properly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your website is now a complete, standalone single-page application ready for Hostinger. No backend or database required!
